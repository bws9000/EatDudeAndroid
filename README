EatDudeAndroid - Java/Android

The main idea here is for Restaurant Owners to input their menus quickly 
and easily via the web. These updated menus are made available immediately 
to the android device. This is in two parts. /EatDudeAndroid is for the device. 
/EatDudeWeb is the admin on the web. A better version would also use googles GEO API to
locate the user instead of manually inputing the country/city/state , but this seemed
like a good option if the Restaurant didn't exist in the google system yet.
